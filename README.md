# Scream for Help - Alpha Version 0.2.0
SturMotor 0.1.1
# Work in Progress
"Scream for Help" is designed to be an episodic text-based Choose Your Own Adventure Game where you play a protaganist desperately trying to make it home.

# What to Expect
I am anticipating having Chapter One completed this year. The dialogue script has been completed and the work in the days and months to come will be less on adding dialogue and more on squashing bugs and finishing the engine upon which the game is based to expedite future chapters.

If you are interested in playing, you would be better suited to checkout the 'working' branch, as that is where the magic is happening. However, I may or may not have had time to perform thorough enough testing to merge with 'master', so that is an important consideration as well.

# Where Can I Play?
From the beta onward, the game will be accessible via the World Wide Web.

For those interested in bleeding edge and want to play the rough, in-development version, you only need to do a few simple things!

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/deadeye007/screamforhelp.git`.
2. [https://www.php.net/downloads](Download PHP from PHP.net)
3. Open a command prompt, navigate to the location where you cloned the repository.
4. Execute the command `php -S localhost:8000`.
5. Open your favorite browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.
6. Enjoy!
