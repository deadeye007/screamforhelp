# Scream for Help - BETA Version 1.0.2
SturMotor 0.1.1

# Work in Progress
"Scream for Help" is designed to be an episodic text-based Choose Your Own Adventure Game where you play a protaganist desperately trying to make it home.


# What to Expect
I am anticipating having Chapter One completed this year. The dialogue script has been completed and the work in the days and months to come will be less on adding dialogue and more on squashing bugs and finishing the engine upon which the game is based to expedite future chapters.


# Where Can I Play?
The game is accessible via the World Wide Web.

1. Open your favorite browser and navigate to [https://scream.bagoftricks.app](https://scream.bagoftricks.app).
